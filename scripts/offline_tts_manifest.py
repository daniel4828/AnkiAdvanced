"""List the TTS files an offline session actually needs (issue #612).

Run on the laptop against the freshly pulled data/offline.db; prints one
`<sha256>.mp3` filename per line for rsync --files-from.

Syncing all of data/tts/ means moving ~120 MB of audio accumulated over
months, most of it for words that aren't due. Over a slow link before a
flight that's the difference between a minute and an hour. The frontend only
ever asks for two kinds of text (see _ttsUrl / _storyAudioUrl in app.js):

    story_sentences.sentence_zh   — listening fronts and "play full story"
    entries.word_zh               — the fallback when a card has no sentence

so the manifest is exactly those two, scoped to what's reachable in the next
few days.
